# Integrating Stream Habitat Metrics 
This repository contains the code to integrate stream habitat metrics from three stream habitat monitoring programs EPA National Aquatic Resources Surveys (NARS), BLM Aquatic Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring, and USFS Aquatic and Riparian Effective Monitoring Program (AREMP). We integrate data based on the data exchange specifications in the [Stream Monitoring Data Exchange Specifications repository](https://github.com/rascully/Stream-Monitoring-Data-Exchange-Specifications). 

# Purpose
Improving data sharing will enable timely access to data, enhance data quality, and create clear channels for better management decisions. Healthy aquatic habitat is critical to fishes, aquatic species, and water quality. Across the US, long-term, large-scale stream habitat monitoring programs collect data for their specific objectives and within their jurisdictional boundaries. Streams cross jurisdictional boundaries and face unprecedented pressure from changing climate, multi-use public lands, and development. To meet these stresses, we integrate data from multiple sources to create a data set of stream metrics across jurisdictional boundaries. We focus on integrating data from the EPA National Aquatic Resources Surveys (NARS), BLM Aquatic Assessment, Inventory and Monitoring, and USFS Aquatic and Riparian Effective Monitoring Program (AREMP). This code integrates a subset of metrics collected on public lands in the Western United States and documents metadata in MonitoringResources.org based on the data exchange specifications and crosswalks outlined in the [Stream Monitoring Data Exchange Specifications repository](https://github.com/rascully/Stream-Monitoring-Data-Exchange-Specifications). 


# Intergrating Stream Habitat Methods 
As a demonstration we integrate stream habitat metrics from four programs. The process is documented in this Rmarkdown file here: https://rpubs.com/rscully/800370
